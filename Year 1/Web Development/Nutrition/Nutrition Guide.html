                <h6>A brief introduction on how to lose weight:</h6>
            </header>
            
            <p>To understand how to lose weight we must first understand how the body functions, i.e. what is it exactly that makes us lose or put on weight. So how does the body work? Well to put it at it's simplest, your body needs a certain amount of calories per day to function and maintain itself. For example, the average male will need to consume 2500 calories per day and a female will need 2000. Therefore taking from this , if you eat more than your daily required caloric intake (caloric surplus) you will put on weight, if you eat the required amount you will stay at your current weight (maintenance) and if you eat less you will lose weight (caloric deficit).</p>
            
            <p>So how does one lose weight then? Well the answer is as simple and complex as the question, yet equally as complex. As stated above, the only way to lose weight is to be in a caloric deficit, this way the body is forced to use up those fat stores to sustain itself. You're looking to be in a deficit of 500 calories, so if your body needs 2500 calories per day, you will be eating 2000. Why 500? Well scientists have found that this is the "golden amount" for weight loss. This way, the body isn't getting enough nutrients so it is forced to use up those fat stores. However, it doesn't go into "starvation mode" where the body isn't getting anywhere near the right amount of nutrients so it begins to actually hold onto food more and store it as fat, so you end up doing the opposite of the desired effect.</p>
            
            <p>Once you have your daily caloric intake down you can take it a step further diving into your daiy macro-nutrition, i.e. your daily protein, carbohydrate and fat intake. I go into this under the macro-nutrtion header. This will also explain why food like pizza and fast food are considered "unhealthy" and this method is used by professionals; for example, pizza will have 36g of carbs per 100g where as 100g of sweet potato will only have 17g, therefore, you will be able to eat more than double the amount of sweet potato than pizza and therefore feel fuller and happier.</p>

			</header>
            
            <p>So how do you know if you are in a caloric deficit? Well the best way is to track your macros, i.e. proteins, fats and carbs. However, that requires a lot of commitment and a better understanding of nutrition; which I will get onto later. The best way is either through portion control or finding out the caloric value of your meal. The best way of finding out the caloric value is too simply download an app called "myfitnesspal" and log your food. Myfitnesspal will also tell you your daily required caloric intake or us the webpage I have linked bellow.</p>
            
            <p>Portion control is probably the best approach, especially for a beginner. To work out a portion simply take your hand and clench it to make a fist; one fist = one portion. Next step is understanding your food groups; i.e. carbs, fats and proteins. Per meal you're going to want one portion of carbs and one portion of protein, for example, a fist full of rice and a chicken breast. Now this doesn't guarantee you are in a calorie deficit, however, for the average populous and a beginner it is very easy and effective. If you wish to take it even further and understand more, I go further in depth into tracking calories and your macros further down.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a useful website for calculating your daily calorie requirements: <a href="http://bmi-calories.com/calorie-intake-calculator.html" target="_blank">Caloric Calculator</a></p>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Will help give you a better idea of what you are eating and where you could be going wrong.</td>
                        <td>Not very accurate therefore doesn't guarantee weight loss.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Offers more control over food for those who haven't tracked food intake previously.</td>
                        <td>Can end up making you over think your food intake and create a negative relationship with food.</td>
                    </tr>

                <h8>Caloric Deficit through Calorie Counting (intermediate):</h8>
            </header>
        <p>Now that we have covered the basics of nutrition and how one can regulate their intake through portion control we can take it one step further by calculating and tracking the caloric value of food to reach our daily intake without going over. I would strongly recommend this method over portion control as this is much more accurate and gives you more control over your food and guarantees results. This method will require you to use MyFitnessPal, I have created a basic guide at the bottom of the page: <a href=""> Myfitnesspal</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Once you have calculated your daily caloric intake it is extemely simple to do. Simply log each meal into MyFitnessPal and it will tell you how many calories you have remaining.</p>

			 <h10>Macro-Nutrition (advanced):</h10>
			</header>
                <p>As stated previously your body needs a certain amount of calories per day to function and we get these calories from our foods. However, we can break this down even further and look at them in further detail. Furthermore, this is done by going into macro-nutrition, i.e. protein, fats and carbs (carbohydrates). Therefore, your body not only needs only a certain amount of calories per day but also a specific amount of carbs, fat and protein per day. This will give you the greatest control over what you can eat and is used by any professional bodybuilder or athlete as it is the most affective, however, does requrie the most effort (less so with a meal plan in place).</p>
            
                <p>So how do we know how many proteins, carbs and fats we need per day? Well, 1 gram of protein will amount to 4kcal, 1 gram of carb will amount to 4kcal and 1 gram of fat will amount to 9kcal. Furthermore, you will want to break you diet down to 40% protein, 40% carbohydrates and 20% fats. Therefore, if you know you need 2500 calories per day you can quickly calculate your macros by taking 40% of 2500 and dividing it by 4 for proteins and carbs and taking 20% of 2500 and dividing it by 9 for your fats.</p>
            
                <p>Once you know your macros you will need to know the macros of food (I have put a table below for quick reference and examples). For this you can either google it or use MyFitnessPal. MyFitnessPal is your best and easiest bet as you can just scan a bar code and it'll tell you all of it's nutritional information. I have made a guide of how to use MyFitnessPal at the bottom of the page. You will also need a weighing scale to weigh your food to know your portion size. Now granted that this is very time consuming weighing and logging all your food everyday this is where a meal plan comes in. Which I will get on to later.</p>
